    "Goal: Create a program to study the consequences of establishing habitat corridors between habitat patches\n",
    "\n",
    "Your framework will have three classes: Individual, Population, and Landscape. Individuals exist in populations and populations exist in landscapes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In every time step, individuals can stay in the population where they started or move to a new population, the probability of which is stored in a dispersal matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Individuals need to have: phenotype attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "Populations need: list of individuals\n",
    "    Constructor to create new list for ind in pop\n",
    "    Methods to add and remove ind\n",
    "    Calc and print the freq of phenotypes among ind\n",
    "    \n",
    "Lanscapes need: list of populations, dispersal matrix\n",
    "    Constructor to create new list for populations in that landscape\n",
    "    Method to use probabilities in dispersal matrix to determine if ind moves or stays each time\n",
    "\n",
    "Dispersal matrix - consists of the probabilities that an ind moves populations or stays in place each time step. \n",
    "    For this species (Warbling Babblers) this corresponds to the possibility of moving in a week\n",
    "    If an ind moves pops, remove it from the list of ind in the pop it started in and add it to the list in the pop it goes to\n",
    "        Do not modify a list that you are looping through inside of the loop itself, do it once the loop is complete\n",
    "    \n",
    "Notes:\n",
    "    Population or landscape constructors should set the starting population sizes\n",
    "    Total number of ind across all populations should stay constant, but ind pops change sizes\n",
    "    \n",
    "When simulation begins, all ind in a population should have the same phenotype. As ind move between pop through time steps (weeks), track the trajectory of phenotype freq and pop sizes\n",
    "    Will need to write a function to create these plots, either as a method of one of the classes or independent \n",
    "    Can overlay pt freq or pop sizes for diff pop on a single plt for easy comparison "
